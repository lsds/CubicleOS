use the images on your blog, as wallpaper, for fun and the like, but you must
link to unikraft.org or xenproject.org
(e.g., `https://xenproject.org/developers/teams/unikraft/`).
Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0 allows you to

 - Adapt: Remix, transform, and build upon the material

for any purpose, even commercially, under the following condition:

 - Attribution: You can use the images and material without attribution when
   used in a context that refers to the Unikraft project, unikraft.org, or

   a Unikraft Hackathon, a Unikraft User Group meeting). Where the context is
   not clear, attribution must be made to unikraft.org or xenproject.org.

   Examples of clear context are:

     Unikraft framework
   - A blog post or article about Unikraft
   - As avatar for a social media account with a reference to the Unikraft
     project in the profile name or in the profile description
   - Giveaways of Unikraft buttons, stickers, mugs, etc. at a Unikraft project
     event or a XenProject event

   Examples where the context is not clear:
   - A freely distributed Unikraft wallpaper or theme
   - Giveaway of a Unikraft button, sticker, mug, etc. at a kids event

The Unikraft logo and mascot was originally created by Alina Volchkova. She
offered it freely to the Unikraft project to be used as project logo and mascot.
As long as her work and its derivates are in use by the project, the project
should make an public acknowledge of her authorship (for example on unikraft.org
and in the repository containing the logo).
