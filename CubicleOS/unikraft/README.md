# Unikraft - Unleash the Power of Unikernels

Unikraft is an automated system for building specialized OSes and
unikernels tailored to the needs of specific applications. It is based
around the concept of small, modular libraries, each providing a part
of the functionality commonly found in an operating system (e.g.,
memory allocation, scheduling, filesystem support, network stack,
etc.).

Unikraft supports multiple target platforms (e.g., Xen, KVM and Linux
userspace for development purposes), so that it is possible to build
multiple images, one for each platform, for a single application
*without* requiring the application developer to do any additional,
platform-specific work. In all, Unikraft is able to build specialized
OSes and unikernels targeted at specific applications without
requiring the time-consuming, expert work that is required today to
build such images.

## Getting Started
The easiest way to get started with Unikraft is to follow the
